    <h1>This is a sample H1 tag of <em>my choosing</em></h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph that is under the first header tag of my choosing</p>
    <h2>This is a smaller H2 tag which, while highly similar to the previous header, is <del>different and also one of my choosing</del> in hindsight, it's mostly the same </h2>
  <p>These paragraphs are really entriguing, don't you think?</p>
    <h3>And wouldn't you know it, here is a <mark>header</mark> that is even smaller than the H2 one and again, is one of my choosing.</h3>
